# In this repository, there are 3 attempts at making a functional grocery list system.

## Attempt 1: Flask
In this attempt, I tried applying the techniques I learned during my CS50 journey. I used Flask (python web framework), SQL (relational database) and Jinja (python html template engine).

## Attempt 2: React
In this attempt, I tried using my early skill on React (javascript web framework) to "bring to life" the grocery system in a more functional/flexible way.
